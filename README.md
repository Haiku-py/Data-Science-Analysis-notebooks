Made a Covid 19 Dashboard in Tableau and processed the data in Python. I fetched the data directly from [Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) where the data is updated on a daily basis. Then, I stored the data in a DataFrame and cleaned and transformed it so that I can use the data to build the dashboard. After that, I created a connection to google sheets that stores the data. Finally, I made a live connection from Tableau with the google sheet where the data is stored such that it is automatically updated on a daily basis.
