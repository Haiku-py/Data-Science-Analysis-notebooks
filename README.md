Made a Covid 19 Dashboard in Tableau and processed the data in Python. I fetched the data directly from [Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) where the data is updated on a daily basis. Then, I stored the data in a DataFrame and cleaned and transformed it so that I can use the data to build the dashboard. After that, I created a connection to google sheets that stores the data. Finally, I made a live connection from Tableau with the google sheet where the data is stored such that it is automatically updated on a daily basis.

## Growth Accounting Chart
[Github](https://github.com/jaspreet-py/Data-Analysis-and-Mining/blob/master/Notebooks/Growth%20Accounting%20Chart.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jaspreet-py/Data-Analysis-and-Mining/blob/master/Notebooks/Growth%20Accounting%20Chart.ipynb)<br>
A Growth Accounting Chart helps us find our **'real'** customer growth rate by factoring in things like Customer Retention and Customer Churn. You can have a more in depth look into the topic [here](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc). I was provided with 2 worksheets, 1 with the device IDs of active users on a weekly basis, and the other one with device IDs of those who uninstalled the app. On the basis of this, I had to calculate **Customer Churn, Customer Retention and New Users** and make a Growth Accounting Chart. More details about the project are present in the notebook itself. 

## Power User Curve

A Power User Curve is basically a histogram the tells us about the user engagement with our app/product. It can be shown on daily, weekly or even monthly basis depending upon the needs of a client. Here, I was provided with a Worksheet containg device IDs of daily active users for each day of the month. My goal was to calculate the number of unique users that were active for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and so on and so forth.
